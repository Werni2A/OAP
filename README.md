# OpenAllegroParser

Purpose of this project is to provide a C++17 library for parsing [Cadence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadence_Design_Systems)'s Allegro binary file formats. This library can be linked to other software for reading/modifying?/writing? Allegro binary files and reading?/writing? XML files.

**See also the complementary project [OpenOrCadParser](https://github.com/Werni2A/OpenOrCadParser).**

The focus lies on

- `*.brd` board database,
- `*.mdd` module definition,
- `*.dra` drawing,
- `*.psm` package symbol,
- `*.ssm` shape symbol,
- `*.fsm` flash symbol,
- `*.osm` format symbol,
- `*.bsm` mechanical symbol, and
- `*.pad` padstack.

See [OrCAD Allegro Files Extension and their Contents](https://vjguptapcb.blogspot.com/2020/08/orcad-allegro-files-extension-and-their.html) or [Cadence Allegro file Extensions and what they contain](https://kumargs-pcb-design.blogspot.com/2009/01/cadence-allegro-file-extensions-and.html) for more information on the file purpose.

# Usage

**I tested with some pads created with version `17.4-2019 S019 (3959056) [7/8/2021]` which works mostly fine. In case you find pads that do not work - with the specified version - please create an issue and append your `*.pad` as well as `*.pxml` files.**

**Note:**

Pad files have some structures with dynamic size where I haven't found a way to calculate those sizes. A workaround to this issue is to brute force all combinations and see when the parser runs without errors. Brute force sounds like a tedious job to do. However, it's quite fast because the amount of possible combinations is relatively low.

Therefore, modify the path to your pad in `findUnknownParameterSet.py` and run it with `python3 findUnknownParameterSet.py`. Hopefully there is a parameter set found that works for your file, and you will see an output similar to the following.

```text
---------------------------------------------
------- Found valid Parameter Set -----------
---------------------------------------------

./build/OpenAllegroParser -i simple_example.pad --numUserLayers 5 --unknownFlag
```

Add the flag `-p` to the command from above and run it as `./build/OpenAllegroParser -i simple_example.pad --numUserLayers 5 --unknownFlag -p` and you will see a similar output with all the pad's information like the one below. At the beginning a lot of debug output is shown that might be not as interesting for you, as for me. Just scroll down to the more important pad information.
